<p>Steven spielberg's Artificial intelligence (2001) came out at the outset of this century. A movie of science fiction genre that delves into the question "what is it to be", a question as old as the conscience. It is a question we are going to continue to look for answers as a species especially in this century when AI is more of a reality than a fiction of far future. </p>
<p>Spielberg, a prolific director, resorted to perpetual evolution of machines to aid human necessity to develop the premise of emergence of the AI. More often than not we see the AI emerged as a Frankenstein-ish accident but here the AI grew as its demand surged with the increasing plight of the developed world due to the global climate change. This is more than, I would argue, a plausible scenario. With the demographic shrinking in the developed world, such is the case in Japan, AI controlled Robots are employed alongside Human labour to work at industry to at home. It is pertinent to discern the relationship between the “mecha” and “orga” in coming decades. </p>
<p>In a society where productivity, efficacy rule over emotion; Love, grief, residuality of human being are seen as limitations to overcome. But in a time when productivity and efficacy become abundant because of Robots we as human begin to learn and admit what makes us human to begin with. Suddenly the decaying nature of human flesh and vulnerability of emotions become desirable. A new world where longings for the old expediates with every advancement of the technology. </p>
<p>Sea level rise has submerged the coastal cities of the world, New York, ‘the end of the world where lion weeps’, was one of them. I don’t remember a time when ruins of a city evoked such an ache in me as was here watching abandoned and submerged New York city from an amphibious copter. A city drowned to it’s tallest of the edifices now inhabited by sea creatures epitomizes wrecked civilization once erected by human.</p>
