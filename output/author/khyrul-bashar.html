                </h2>

                
                

                <p>+, * both are quantifiers. That is they don't themselves match any pattern but check for repetition or presence of the pattern they are used after. One example will clear things up.</p>
<p>Assume, we want to match some numbers</p>
<ul>
<li>9</li>
<li>90</li>
<li>234</li>
<li>2275258292335728520</li>
</ul>
<p>To match numbers we can use character class <code>[0-9]</code> or <code>\d</code>, both work the same. but there is one problem, <code>\d</code> or <code>[0-9]</code> both matches number with one digit only. i.e. will match 9 only not other numbers with more digits. So to match two digit number our regex should be <code>\d\d</code>, for three digit numbers <code>\d\d\d</code> and so on. You see the problem?</p>
<p>Firstly, it's tiring to write repeating characters and secondly what if we don't know the count of digits of the number beforehand. Here comes the quantifiers to rescue. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>+ -&gt; matches at least one and more of the pattern it&#39;s used after.`
* -&gt; matches none or more of the patterns it&#39;s used after.`
</pre></div>


<p>Going back to the previous example, we want to match numbers be it one digit or more, we make our regex <code>\d+</code> i.e. one + plus after digit matching pattern <code>\d</code>. Now it matches all of the numbers.</p>
<p>Now let's imagine a scenario where we want to match <code>a</code> that has no <code>b</code> after it or lots of <code>b</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>a</li>
<li>ab</li>
<li>abbbb</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to write a regex that matches all of the above. So if we write a regex <code>ab+</code> we fail to match the lone <code>a</code> cause <code>+</code> matches one or more <code>b</code>, not none. Here we use <code>*</code> . it matches none or more of the pattern. So regex <code>ab*</code> will match all of the above three strings including the first one where there is no <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>Hope this demystify <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> for you.</p>

<p>We are what our identities portray us to be. A veil that is insurmountable yet constructed at its core. We walk the walk it let us, we eat what it feeds us, we talk to the limit it permeates. Yet intricacies of identity are not so apparent until an up close look. “Nema-ye Nazdik” aka “close up” (1999) by Abbas kiarostami from Iran scrolls camera through a real event of identity fraud in an attempt to untangle the knots of identities that bind us together.</p>
<p>Time, a prison we are detained in eternally, doesn’t opportune us to watch beyond us. Despite our colossal attempt to break the time into Past, Present and Future only present is present though just a one way sequence of sparks. We do what we do without really knowing why we do. Though language has been pushed to describe or reason out our actions in a close up look everything skims down to phantoms, inapprehensible moments filled with void beyond reasoning. This ethos of imprisonment in time mixed with identity complex build the motif of the “Close up” story. </p>
<p>In the post-revolution Iran visual media has led to a diminished scope for the printing industry displacing the printing workers earning bread. Sabzian is one of such fateful workers who has a passion for art and films but no means to take part in. A destitute, poor sabzian gradually grows an inner monologue portraying himself as his favourite director, Mohsen Makhbalf, who, he opines, voices the plight of the suffering masses. Often this complexity of daydreaming comes out open whenever the situation opportunes. At one instance things go far enough to call the police. From here our screen lights up, then goes in to ask what makes up the identity which is so preponderant in our social fabrics.</p>

<p>An America that is fighting now with the monster within, a monster that wants to undone the civil liberty achieved through decades of struggle, is let to recollect once again the greatest achievement, landing man on the moon, in the movie “Hidden Figures” but this time to celebrate the figures those were marginalized then and kept behind the curtain until now. “Hidden figures” embarks on to shed light on the widespread racialism in the USA in 1960s contemporary by rolling its lense inside the NASA when it was enjoying nationwide reverberation for its effort to put man in the space and thus taking the American identity to a new height.</p>
<p>Exactly 100 years had passed after the American Civil war in 1861, the USA is competing in another war, this time an external belligerent, USSR, to instate its supremacy in space. Day and night, man and women were working at NASA to make good on the promise the politicians made to their constituencies and to the world. A nation about to fly to the moon yet its “soul” crippled by the segregation, maintaining separate provisions for whites and blacks, even at the NASA. </p>
<p>Black women were designated as “colored computer” who were to verify as well as do the cumbersome calculations for the engineers. Among them three prodigious women who are friends themselves as well are the protagonists of the cinema. We see the repressed lives of blacks in America through the eyes of and with Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson employed as colored computers at NASA and later climbing the ladder on their own credit. </p>
<p>Watching blatant and omnipresent maltreatment of a part of the society by another is nauseating still continuous comical reliefs accompanied by soothing music helps us to remain sane and entertained. This Biographical Drama film will reinvigorate the inspiration of equalities in the American societies which has kept it great all through the 20th century, as well will help, I hope, the USA in search of its lost rigours of “greatness” to “make America great again”.</p>

<p>In actuality Wings of Desire, a movie from 1987, is a poetry. This was my first expression immediately after the 160 minutes long movie. That vindication remains same after two days and another re-watch. 
This is one of those few times when I really don’t have anything coherent to say about the art I enjoyed so much. It is not long ago that I made peace with the distance I have with poetry, previously ignored, denied, vehemently opposed and now I believe Poetry is here to usher us in the labyrinth that language is. Watching this movie has solidified my conviction on that.</p>

<p>Comedian Jordan Peele’s first feature film “Get out” have an original as well as thrilling screenplay to entice you into a sitting of hundred minutes of comedy, drama and horror. </p>
<p>A social satire movie turns into a horror thriller with every passing frames. Movie title starts in the backdrop of a sun drenched forest fringed by a highway. But not long before crippling silence engulfs the serenity when a deer hits the car carrying a frisky couple.</p>
<p>A Black boyfriend comes, however reluctantly, to his girlfriend’s family country estate to meet her parents. Liberal parents, who would vote for Obama for third time if they could, welcome Chris (the boyfriend) with awkward jokes. I couldn’t stop myself seeing a parallel between the pretentious liberal father and untravelled moderate muslims around us who wear a veil of tolerance only to surface up whenever put on test. 
While heap of hypocrisies mount on, we also notice some oddities around, so does Chris. </p>
<p>Would I recommend to watch?</p>

<p>Ya, it’s thrilling 100 minutes.</p>

<p>Ready player one(2018), directed by steven spielberg, is Hollywood's equivalent of “Message movie”. Virtual world empowers the little guys, but deep immersion of populace in the virtual world brings havoc unto the real one. As real world is real, after all, we better have a balance in real and virtual life.</p>
<p>This is all there is in the movie. </p>
<p>The movie tells story of a time in future when humans stopped solving their problem instead they were simply trying to outlive those problems. People took refuge to a virtual world leaving the real world only for eating, shitting and sleeping. Aren’t we already doing that? </p>
<p>Anyway, the movie is about good governance in the Oasis, name of that virtual world. A fight between the good guys and corporate profitteres to take hold of the key to the Oasis. I won’t say no more, will spoil it for you. </p>
<p>If you are really excited for some good CGI dig into the movie, otherwise not so much.</p>

<p>‘Requiem for a dream’(2000), a movie adopted from a book of same title, is of Psychological drama genre primarily explores the pleasure driven compulsiveness of its four protagonists. Whenever we talk about addiction drug abuse comes to fore right away. That is such, for drug addiction has ostensive impact on its user as well as to other institutions related to its user. But more often than not we forget other addictive substances and pursuits prevalent in our day to day life. This movie has successfully drawn its audience's attention to some of those and sketched a grim picture of their implications as well.</p>
<p>Happiness, often, is confused with pleasure. Yet happiness is a virtue to attain while pleasure is a state of brain stemming from pleasurable visual such as porn or TV, nerve stimulating drug intaking, sugar ingesting, daydreaming and many such others. Our brain differentiates pleasure from other experiences but pleasure from anything and everything works the same. Whenever we bite a pizza full of cheese, meat and other spicy ingredients dopamine rushes to our sensory. A feel good entices us. This same neurological process takes place whenever someone ‘love’s our post on facebook or instagram. No matter how counter intuitive it may seem, this is true for marijuana intaking to sugar dripping “Rosshogolla” devouring. Shopping too gives us dopamine rush which explains why some of us can’t come back home from malls without depleting the wallet. </p>
<p>Despite our high regard for happiness, we have built a society which in all practicality depends on its members pleasure seeking behaviour. Consumerism is pleaserism. A constant impulse to fill a hole by buying stuff yet that hole remains as it always has been. We are told or taught how imperfection dragging us to unhappiness, so we must strive at all time to be happy at any cost. But the hole can’t be incessantly be fed, some have means some don’t. Pleasure is sold in a happiness wrapped packet. And brain being the way it is, has fall for it for millennia, more so now than ever. Advertisement, friends photos of ‘perfect’ celebration of life in news-feeds evokes a sense of guilty in us for we have failed to make us happy. </p>
<p>Depression or such conditions get prevalent. Some die in desperation and most others take refuge to escapist pursuits; Drugs, cat videos, never ending feed scrolling, porn, TV and maybe daydreaming too. </p>
<p>Addiction is such, even though we are aware of the control it has over us we are too numb to have any control over it. Helplessness encroaches the sense of our being. We do things beyond us. ‘Requiem for a dream’ depicts such desperation of four addicted protagonists all too well in its ‘winter’ act. Three part of the film; Summer, Fall, Winter; in that sequence, tells a story of a widowed TV obsessed mother, her heroin addicted son with his two other friends. </p>
<p>Symbolism and metaphors have been used over and over again in story telling though never evoking boredom. As story progressed color of the frames faded, gradually, away despite starting in a shining suburban landscape, letting us a stroll in the dark ally of pleasure.</p>

                <p><img alt="AI Poster" src="/images/AI.jpg"></p>
<p>Steven spielberg's Artificial intelligence (2001) came out at the outset of this century. A movie of science fiction genre that delves into the question "what is it to be", a question as old as the conscience. It is a question we are going to continue to look for answers as a species especially in this century when AI is more of a reality than a fiction of far future. </p>
<p>Spielberg, a prolific director, resorted to perpetual evolution of machines to aid human necessity to develop the premise of emergence of the AI. More often than not we see the AI emerged as a Frankenstein-ish accident but here the AI grew as its demand surged with the increasing plight of the developed world due to the global climate change. This is more than, I would argue, a plausible scenario. With the demographic shrinking in the developed world, such is the case in Japan, AI controlled Robots are employed alongside Human labour to work at industry to at home. It is pertinent to discern the relationship between the “mecha” and “orga” in coming decades. </p>
<p>In a society where productivity, efficacy rule over emotion; Love, grief, residuality of human being are seen as limitations to overcome. But in a time when productivity and efficacy become abundant because of Robots we as human begin to learn and admit what makes us human to begin with. Suddenly the decaying nature of human flesh and vulnerability of emotions become desirable. A new world where longings for the old expediates with every advancement of the technology. </p>
<p>Sea level rise has submerged the coastal cities of the world, New York, ‘the end of the world where lion weeps’, was one of them. I don’t remember a time when ruins of a city evoked such an ache in me as was here watching abandoned and submerged New York city from an amphibious copter. A city drowned to it’s tallest of the edifices now inhabited by sea creatures epitomizes wrecked civilization once erected by human.</p>

<p>"Contact"(1997) by Robert Zemeckis is said to be of science fiction genre. Though, I would say, it's more of a science fiction movie where science is used to justify the religiosity of the 95%(the movie claims 95% of the world believe in God). Main point of argument is "absence of proof doesn't negate the existence". </p>
<p>A girl inspired by her father set her life in quest of extraterrestrial life. There are blocks, challenges but our protagonist overcome all of those by her sheer inertia of will. Movie is science-y in its attire but depends on cinematic turn of events to propel its story. Not much can be said without spoiling it. </p>
<p>To me, like "Forrest Gump" it is another movie where director has had a great direction while appealing to masses comfortness in vague notion of spirituality.</p>

                <h1>GoLog Day 2</h1>
<h3>Only "for" loop is real</h3>
<h6>@6:05PM</h6>
<p>There is only one loop expression in Go. That is for loop. As other languages loop expression construct is same i.e. there is an init statement, condition expression and post statement. 
but  unlike other languages like C, Java, or Javascript there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces { } are always required.
As usual for loop
        for i := 0; i&lt;10; i++{
                sum +=i
            }
Without initial and post statement</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        for ; i&lt;10; {
            sum +=i
        }
</pre></div>


<p>We can choose to not use those semicolons there and now it looks like while loop. voila!
            for i&lt;10{
                    sum +=i
            }
And there is a forever loop also and like others it can be achived via for loop. Omitting conditional expression and init and post statement turns a for loop into forever loop. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        for {
                sum +=i
        }
</pre></div>


<h3>If statement</h3>
<h6>@6:30PM</h6>
<p>If statements like for loop don't have any parentheses surrounding the condition statement. Short statement can be placed before condition statement and variables have scope inside if &amp; else blocks.
    func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
        if v := math.Pow(x, n); v &lt; lim {
            return v
        } else {
            fmt.Printf("%g &gt;= %g\n", v, lim)
        }
        // can't use v here, though
        return lim
    }
I've just noticied math pacakage accepts mostly float64 type arguments while using pow function from math package. </p>
<h6>@6:40 I took a small break</h6>
<p>Watched this video of franc tv. God I love Iran. I don't know if it's mogol colonialism that's acting within me. But I really look forward to the future Iran has to offer. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDac-DnvUIs</p>
<h6>@7:10 Newton-rhapson's method for finding sqrt</h6>
<p>In go tutorial there is an excercise for finding sqrt of numbers for better understanding of loop and functions in go. I knew about the newton method but to brush up the idea I've gone throw this article from MIT. https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/chapter1/node9.html
This is my implementation. Well, coding was really smooth. I didn't feel like I'm codig a new langauge.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
    z := float64(1)
    for z&gt;0{
        new_z := (x/z + z)/2
        fmt.Println(z, new_z)
        if v := math.Abs(z-new_z); v&lt;0.00001{
            return new_z
        }
        z = new_z
    }
    return z
}
</pre></div>


<h4>Switch-case</h4>
<h6>@7:56PM</h6>
<p>Not so mutch surprise in switch statement. It also support short statement before placing the condition variable.</p>
<h3>defer</h3>
<h6>@8:15PM</h6>
<p>I exactly don't know why would I use this feature but looks very interesting. </p>
<h6>@8:30PM</h6>
<p>https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover This blog explains it all. Now I know I'm going to use it where and when. </p>

                <h1>Go-log (Day 1)</h1>
<p>I've already once tried to learn go months ago but didn't really push it seriously enough to complete the beginner level. This time I hope to touch the end line. </p>
<h3>First tutorial</h3>
<h6>@ 2:20 PM</h6>
<p>Googling "go tutorial" land me to interactive go tutorial made by go team. Comprising a code editor and server side code running, if you are familier with codeacademy you have already seen this, just a less glossy version. If you have go installed, you have the whole tutorial offline right from your browser, Cool!
link - <a href="https://tour.golang.org/">A Tour of go</a></p>
<h3>Type declaration</h3>
<h6>@2:40 PM</h6>
<p>type declaration is slightly different in go than other C family lanaguages. just in first glance what I got is 
in C</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int x,  int main(int arg, char argc[])
</pre></div>


<p>in go</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>x int,  func main(arg int, argv []char) int
</pre></div>


<p>The tutorial linked a nice article discussing the difference of type declaration in go from C. <a href="http://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax">Go's Declaration Syntax</a></p>
<h3>Multiple results</h3>
<h6>@ 3:10 PM</h6>
<p>Most exciting thing so far. A function can return more than one result. Now it remembers me of my second or third week of college. My crush asked(well, of course she doesn't know about crush thing) me asked about how to return more than one result from a function in C and I have spent hours in despair to accomplish it ! :D   </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
      return y, x
}
</pre></div>


<h4>Exported names must start with a capital letter</h4>
<h6>@3:20 PM</h6>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>fmt.Println(34)
</pre></div>


<p>here 'P' of Println is in capital.</p>
<h3>var</h3>
<h6>@3:26 PM</h6>
<p>var is used to declare a list of variables. I've seen this in C# and javascript.
    var i,j int
There is an interesting way to initialize the variable.
    var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"</p>
<p>there is := short assignment statement.
    k := 3 
without explicit type declaration. But it can only be used inside the function body while var is allowded inside package and function.</p>
<h4>Basic types</h4>
<h6>@3:40 PM</h6>
<p>For me two types are new, rune and complex (complex64 complex128)
rune is alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point. The "rune" name is new, I have to see why this namaing.</p>
<p>var, const and import can be factored.
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/cmplx"
)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var (
      ToBe   bool       = false
      MaxInt uint64  = 1&lt;&lt;64 - 1
      z  complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)
</pre></div>


<h4>Initial values</h4>
<h6>@4:02 PM</h6>
<p>for numeric variables 0.
for boolean false.
for string " " empty string.</p>
<h4>Type conversion</h4>
<h6>@4:07 PM</h6>
<p>The expression T(v) converts the value v to the type T. const is the keyword for declaring constant. only "=" can be used to declare const. </p>
<h6>@4: 12 PM</h6>
<p>First part of Basics( Packages, variables, and functions) has been finished, I got a brief experience of the go syntax.</p>

                <h3>It has started after all.</h3>
<p>Summer has started as much awesomely as possible for me. Write code, get feedback, update and learn. What else you need if you love to code! One of the most anticipated event for me was participating in GSOC (<a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google Summer of Code</a>) and after trying for two consecutive years I was at last <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/kbashar/5676830073815040">selected</a> this year. And I’m coding this year in Apache foundation and  to be more precise in <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/">PDFBox</a>. After almost month long community bonding phase code writing phase has after all started from 25th May.</p>
<h3>Code is being committed</h3>
<p>Though community bonding was to get introduced with the community and getting your hands wet with code base and documentation I was some steps already walked on these. So have started code earlier though didn’t make remarkable patches. Don’t know, may be it’s always slow for the first time. :D Anyway already I’ve made three patches, two of them slightly large in size :) </p>
<h3>Coding plan</h3>
<p>My mentor wants me to make little patches as those are easy to merge and refactor for both of us and I’m highly appreciating on this. The patches I’ve submitted helped me to learn a lot already while giving the community the opportunity to use the just backed features. Which in turn gives me feedback to make code better. </p>
<h3>Blogging plan</h3>
<p>I'm planning to write experience-per-patch post. I hope it also doesn't become another mountain lifting promise because of my procrastination. :D</p>

                <p>Main code for this patch was ready for GSOC as I’ve coded it <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-2748">earlier</a> for PDFReader of the PDFBox tools. So it was just about  reuseing the RecentFiles class with PDFDebugger. </p>
<p>From this patch I’ve learnt an interesting thing. In RecentFiles class I’ve used Preference API of java to store application preference data. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html">Preference API</a> gives you one instance per Package. </p>
<p>PDFReader and PDFDebugger both are in same the package so they show the same recent files log. Though I was first confused about the behaviour and was planning to move PDFDebugger to a new package but tilman happened to like it :). So a potential bug became a feature. :)</p>

                <p>As a gsoc student I'm going to code to improve the <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/1.8/commandline.html#pdfDebugger">PDFDebugger</a> tool of the <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/" title="PDFBOX">PDFBOX</a> this summer. PDFBox is from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" title="Apache">apache </a> foundation. </p>
<p>PDFDebugger helps you to inspect the internal data in a structured and readable way which in turn paves a way to debug your PDF files. The PDFBOX already has a PDFDebugger which provides some fundamental facilities to user but lacks many more which are very useful for PDF detective works. My project is to improve this tool and make it useable and friendlier for the users as much as possible. The features I'm going to add are from the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-2530">PDFBOX-2530</a> jira issue. If time permits, I may code some more. </p>
<p>My mentor is <a href="https://twitter.com/Passwort12345">Tilman Hausherr</a>. I contacted with him in mid of the November of 2014 and from the beginning he was very helpful to get me on the track. Really lucky to have someone like him right beside me as a guide in the journey of learning, exploring and doing.
I’m hopeful to spent a fun summer while completing the GSOC as success story.</p>

                <p>I was just trying to solve <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/halloween-party" title="Halloween party">this</a> warmup problem in HackerRank. I was confident about getting it right by the first try. I was wrong. I was writing the expression wrong in first look which wasn't so vivid.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">k</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">;</span>

</pre></div>


<p>prints <code>7</code> but I was expecting <code>6</code>. Well, I think I should explain what is expected here. If k is even output will be square of <code>k/2</code> (as in integer division) while in case of odd output is <code>k/2</code> is multiplied with <code>k/2 + 1</code>. That is for <code>5</code> output calculated like <code>5/2 = 2</code> and then <code>2*(2+1) = 6</code>.
So when I realized there may be something wrong the precedence I wrote like below which gave expected the result.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)?</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)*(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">):((</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)*(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">));</span>

<p>But it's a solution using parentheses and to get the understanding what's going on here I tried it like below</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)?</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)*(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">):</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*((</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">));</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and again I got the expected result.
So it's clear that I've wrong understanding in operator precedence in Java and hit the google to get the gist. The second link from Princeton was a bookmark worth link, a crystal-clear explanation on operator precedence.
In Java to evaluate an expression first operator precedence is looked then the associativity. So in my first expression after evaluating <code>(5/2)+1</code> expression stands like <code>3*5/2</code>. Now * and / both have same precedence and evaluation works using associativity. Both * and / are left associative that is <code>3*5/2</code> is <code>(3*5)/2</code> that is <code>15/2</code> and the result is <code>7</code>. 
In the third case after evaluating <code>(5/2)+1</code> expression stands like <code>5/2*3</code> and for the sake of associativity it's <code>(5/2)*3</code> and the result is <code>2*3 = 6</code>.</p>
<p>The Princeton article has some interesting exercises in the end and they are way more interesting. I'm giving an example.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;1 + 2 = &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;1 + 2 = &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">));</span>
</pre></div>


<p>First expression prints <code>1 + 2 = 12</code> and</p>
<p>second one prints <code>1 + 2 = 3</code>. 
For the explanation, I would recommend you to read <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/" title="Operator Precedence in Java">the article</a></p>
