<p>We are what our identities portray us to be. A veil that is insurmountable yet constructed at its core. We walk the walk it let us, we eat what it feeds us, we talk to the limit it permeates. Yet intricacies of identity are not so apparent until an up close look. “Nema-ye Nazdik” aka “close up” (1999) by Abbas kiarostami from Iran scrolls camera through a real event of identity fraud in an attempt to untangle the knots of identities that bind us together.</p>
<p>Time, a prison we are detained in eternally, doesn’t opportune us to watch beyond us. Despite our colossal attempt to break the time into Past, Present and Future only present is present though just a one way sequence of sparks. We do what we do without really knowing why we do. Though language has been pushed to describe or reason out our actions in a close up look everything skims down to phantoms, inapprehensible moments filled with void beyond reasoning. This ethos of imprisonment in time mixed with identity complex build the motif of the “Close up” story. </p>
<p>In the post-revolution Iran visual media has led to a diminished scope for the printing industry displacing the printing workers earning bread. Sabzian is one of such fateful workers who has a passion for art and films but no means to take part in. A destitute, poor sabzian gradually grows an inner monologue portraying himself as his favourite director, Mohsen Makhbalf, who, he opines, voices the plight of the suffering masses. Often this complexity of daydreaming comes out open whenever the situation opportunes. At one instance things go far enough to call the police. From here our screen lights up, then goes in to ask what makes up the identity which is so preponderant in our social fabrics.</p>
