<p>An America that is fighting now with the monster within, a monster that wants to undone the civil liberty achieved through decades of struggle, is let to recollect once again the greatest achievement, landing man on the moon, in the movie “Hidden Figures” but this time to celebrate the figures those were marginalized then and kept behind the curtain until now. “Hidden figures” embarks on to shed light on the widespread racialism in the USA in 1960s contemporary by rolling its lense inside the NASA when it was enjoying nationwide reverberation for its effort to put man in the space and thus taking the American identity to a new height.</p>
<p>Exactly 100 years had passed after the American Civil war in 1861, the USA is competing in another war, this time an external belligerent, USSR, to instate its supremacy in space. Day and night, man and women were working at NASA to make good on the promise the politicians made to their constituencies and to the world. A nation about to fly to the moon yet its “soul” crippled by the segregation, maintaining separate provisions for whites and blacks, even at the NASA. </p>
<p>Black women were designated as “colored computer” who were to verify as well as do the cumbersome calculations for the engineers. Among them three prodigious women who are friends themselves as well are the protagonists of the cinema. We see the repressed lives of blacks in America through the eyes of and with Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson employed as colored computers at NASA and later climbing the ladder on their own credit. </p>
<p>Watching blatant and omnipresent maltreatment of a part of the society by another is nauseating still continuous comical reliefs accompanied by soothing music helps us to remain sane and entertained. This Biographical Drama film will reinvigorate the inspiration of equalities in the American societies which has kept it great all through the 20th century, as well will help, I hope, the USA in search of its lost rigours of “greatness” to “make America great again”.</p>

<p>In actuality Wings of Desire, a movie from 1987, is a poetry. This was my first expression immediately after the 160 minutes long movie. That vindication remains same after two days and another re-watch. 
This is one of those few times when I really don’t have anything coherent to say about the art I enjoyed so much. It is not long ago that I made peace with the distance I have with poetry, previously ignored, denied, vehemently opposed and now I believe Poetry is here to usher us in the labyrinth that language is. Watching this movie has solidified my conviction on that.</p>

<p>Comedian Jordan Peele’s first feature film “Get out” have an original as well as thrilling screenplay to entice you into a sitting of hundred minutes of comedy, drama and horror. </p>
<p>A social satire movie turns into a horror thriller with every passing frames. Movie title starts in the backdrop of a sun drenched forest fringed by a highway. But not long before crippling silence engulfs the serenity when a deer hits the car carrying a frisky couple.</p>
<p>A Black boyfriend comes, however reluctantly, to his girlfriend’s family country estate to meet her parents. Liberal parents, who would vote for Obama for third time if they could, welcome Chris (the boyfriend) with awkward jokes. I couldn’t stop myself seeing a parallel between the pretentious liberal father and untravelled moderate muslims around us who wear a veil of tolerance only to surface up whenever put on test. 
While heap of hypocrisies mount on, we also notice some oddities around, so does Chris. </p>
<p>Would I recommend to watch?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ya, it’s thrilling 100 minutes.</p>

<p>Ready player one(2018), directed by steven spielberg, is Hollywood's equivalent of “Message movie”. Virtual world empowers the little guys, but deep immersion of populace in the virtual world brings havoc unto the real one. As real world is real, after all, we better have a balance in real and virtual life.</p>
<p>This is all there is in the movie. </p>
<p>The movie tells story of a time in future when humans stopped solving their problem instead they were simply trying to outlive those problems. People took refuge to a virtual world leaving the real world only for eating, shitting and sleeping. Aren’t we already doing that? </p>
<p>Anyway, the movie is about good governance in the Oasis, name of that virtual world. A fight between the good guys and corporate profitteres to take hold of the key to the Oasis. I won’t say no more, will spoil it for you. </p>
<p>If you are really excited for some good CGI dig into the movie, otherwise not so much.</p>

                <p><img alt="AI Poster" src="/images/AI.jpg"></p>
<p>Steven spielberg's Artificial intelligence (2001) came out at the outset of this century. A movie of science fiction genre that delves into the question "what is it to be", a question as old as the conscience. It is a question we are going to continue to look for answers as a species especially in this century when AI is more of a reality than a fiction of far future. </p>
<p>Spielberg, a prolific director, resorted to perpetual evolution of machines to aid human necessity to develop the premise of emergence of the AI. More often than not we see the AI emerged as a Frankenstein-ish accident but here the AI grew as its demand surged with the increasing plight of the developed world due to the global climate change. This is more than, I would argue, a plausible scenario. With the demographic shrinking in the developed world, such is the case in Japan, AI controlled Robots are employed alongside Human labour to work at industry to at home. It is pertinent to discern the relationship between the “mecha” and “orga” in coming decades. </p>
<p>In a society where productivity, efficacy rule over emotion; Love, grief, residuality of human being are seen as limitations to overcome. But in a time when productivity and efficacy become abundant because of Robots we as human begin to learn and admit what makes us human to begin with. Suddenly the decaying nature of human flesh and vulnerability of emotions become desirable. A new world where longings for the old expediates with every advancement of the technology. </p>
<p>Sea level rise has submerged the coastal cities of the world, New York, ‘the end of the world where lion weeps’, was one of them. I don’t remember a time when ruins of a city evoked such an ache in me as was here watching abandoned and submerged New York city from an amphibious copter. A city drowned to it’s tallest of the edifices now inhabited by sea creatures epitomizes wrecked civilization once erected by human.</p>

                <p><img alt="contact poster" src="/images/contact.jpg"></p>
<p>"Contact"(1997) by Robert Zemeckis is said to be of science fiction genre. Though, I would say, it's more of a science fiction movie where science is used to justify the religiosity of the 95%(the movie claims 95% of the world believe in God). Main point of argument is "absence of proof doesn't negate the existence". </p>
<p>A girl inspired by her father set her life in quest of extraterrestrial life. There are blocks, challenges but our protagonist overcome all of those by her sheer inertia of will. Movie is science-y in its attire but depends on cinematic turn of events to propel its story. Not much can be said without spoiling it. </p>
<p>To me, like "Forrest Gump" it is another movie where director has had a great direction while appealing to masses comfortness in vague notion of spirituality.</p>
