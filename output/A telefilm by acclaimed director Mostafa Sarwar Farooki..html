                <h4>a telefilm by acclaimed director Mostafa Sarwar Farooki.</h4>
<p>To streamline leadership humans have created institutions and to functionalize those faceless bureaucracies have been established, this is pertinent to curb out the whimsical human intervention which are deemed as inefficient and at times irrational. So to yield better result we have law, rules of procedure, we have hierarchy to ensure the adoption of these rules. 
Where laws and bureaucracy turned cold hard mechanisms, inane to human sufferings. A faceless bureaucracy, consisting of ladder upon ladder and of shrinking hope only to end with unalterable law that is lost on its human aspect!</p>

<p>More than 500 defence personnel were hanged by Ziaur Rahman administration in the pretext of a Air force mutiny in 1977. It is complained that there were court marshal only in name, people were hanged just for sharing same name, to appease the authority, to negate the political competition. Mostafa Sarwar Faruki directed telefilm “Ayesha” tells the story of one such Air force corporal, Joynul, hanged despite his affirmative efforts to nullify the mutiny.</p>
<p>Ayesha, Joynul’s recently married wife from his village, an educated girl, faces a harsh reality, alone in their new home at Dhaka when honeymoon period of the couple yet to fade away. Joynul has been accused of participating in the mutiny, jailed in unknown place. Ayesha has to embark on a journey to rescue her husband. She climbs stairs up and down, “Sir” after “Sir” listen to Ayesha, days cumulates to months only to dead ends. Ayesha faces a faceless cold bureaucracy, as is evident in its soulless actions one after another, which has no inkling to the fact that it is there to serve human.</p>
