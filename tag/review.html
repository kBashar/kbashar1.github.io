                <h4>a telefilm by acclaimed director Mostafa Sarwar Farooki.</h4>
<p>To streamline leadership humans have created institutions and to functionalize those faceless bureaucracies have been established, this is pertinent to curb out the whimsical human intervention which are deemed as inefficient and at times irrational. So to yield better result we have law, rules of procedure, we have hierarchy to ensure the adoption of these rules. 
Where laws and bureaucracy turned cold hard mechanisms, inane to human sufferings. A faceless bureaucracy, consisting of ladder upon ladder and of shrinking hope only to end with unalterable law that is lost on its human aspect!</p>
<p><img alt="Ayesha Poster" src="/images/Ayesha.jpg"></p>
<p>More than 500 defence personnel were hanged by Ziaur Rahman administration in the pretext of a Air force mutiny in 1977. It is complained that there were court marshal only in name, people were hanged just for sharing same name, to appease the authority, to negate the political competition. Mostafa Sarwar Faruki directed telefilm “Ayesha” tells the story of one such Air force corporal, Joynul, hanged despite his affirmative efforts to nullify the mutiny.</p>
<p>Ayesha, Joynul’s recently married wife from his village, an educated girl, faces a harsh reality, alone in their new home at Dhaka when honeymoon period of the couple yet to fade away. Joynul has been accused of participating in the mutiny, jailed in unknown place. Ayesha has to embark on a journey to rescue her husband. She climbs stairs up and down, “Sir” after “Sir” listen to Ayesha, days cumulates to months only to dead ends. Ayesha faces a faceless cold bureaucracy, as is evident in its soulless actions one after another, which has no inkling to the fact that it is there to serve human.</p>

<p>Ready player one(2018), directed by steven spielberg, is Hollywood's equivalent of “Message movie”. Virtual world empowers the little guys, but deep immersion of populace in the virtual world brings havoc unto the real one. As real world is real, after all, we better have a balance in real and virtual life.</p>
<p>This is all there is in the movie. </p>
<p>The movie tells story of a time in future when humans stopped solving their problem instead they were simply trying to outlive those problems. People took refuge to a virtual world leaving the real world only for eating, shitting and sleeping. Aren’t we already doing that? </p>
<p>Anyway, the movie is about good governance in the Oasis, name of that virtual world. A fight between the good guys and corporate profitteres to take hold of the key to the Oasis. I won’t say no more, will spoil it for you. </p>
<p>If you are really excited for some good CGI dig into the movie, otherwise not so much.</p>

                <p><img alt="AI Poster" src="/images/AI.jpg"></p>
<p>Steven spielberg's Artificial intelligence (2001) came out at the outset of this century. A movie of science fiction genre that delves into the question "what is it to be", a question as old as the conscience. It is a question we are going to continue to look for answers as a species especially in this century when AI is more of a reality than a fiction of far future. </p>
<p>Spielberg, a prolific director, resorted to perpetual evolution of machines to aid human necessity to develop the premise of emergence of the AI. More often than not we see the AI emerged as a Frankenstein-ish accident but here the AI grew as its demand surged with the increasing plight of the developed world due to the global climate change. This is more than, I would argue, a plausible scenario. With the demographic shrinking in the developed world, such is the case in Japan, AI controlled Robots are employed alongside Human labour to work at industry to at home. It is pertinent to discern the relationship between the “mecha” and “orga” in coming decades. </p>
<p>In a society where productivity, efficacy rule over emotion; Love, grief, residuality of human being are seen as limitations to overcome. But in a time when productivity and efficacy become abundant because of Robots we as human begin to learn and admit what makes us human to begin with. Suddenly the decaying nature of human flesh and vulnerability of emotions become desirable. A new world where longings for the old expediates with every advancement of the technology. </p>
<p>Sea level rise has submerged the coastal cities of the world, New York, ‘the end of the world where lion weeps’, was one of them. I don’t remember a time when ruins of a city evoked such an ache in me as was here watching abandoned and submerged New York city from an amphibious copter. A city drowned to it’s tallest of the edifices now inhabited by sea creatures epitomizes wrecked civilization once erected by human.</p>

                <p><img alt="contact poster" src="/images/contact.jpg"></p>
<p>"Contact"(1997) by Robert Zemeckis is said to be of science fiction genre. Though, I would say, it's more of a science fiction movie where science is used to justify the religiosity of the 95%(the movie claims 95% of the world believe in God). Main point of argument is "absence of proof doesn't negate the existence". </p>
<p>A girl inspired by her father set her life in quest of extraterrestrial life. There are blocks, challenges but our protagonist overcome all of those by her sheer inertia of will. Movie is science-y in its attire but depends on cinematic turn of events to propel its story. Not much can be said without spoiling it. </p>
<p>To me, like "Forrest Gump" it is another movie where director has had a great direction while appealing to masses comfortness in vague notion of spirituality.</p>
