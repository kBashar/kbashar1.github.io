<p>Ready player one(2018), directed by steven spielberg, is Hollywood's equivalent of “Message movie”. Virtual world empowers the little guys, but deep immersion of populace in the virtual world brings havoc unto the real one. As real world is real, after all, we better have a balance in real and virtual life.</p>
<p>This is all there is in the movie. </p>
<p>The movie tells story of a time in future when humans stopped solving their problem instead they were simply trying to outlive those problems. People took refuge to a virtual world leaving the real world only for eating, shitting and sleeping. Aren’t we already doing that? </p>
<p>Anyway, the movie is about good governance in the Oasis, name of that virtual world. A fight between the good guys and corporate profitteres to take hold of the key to the Oasis. I won’t say no more, will spoil it for you. </p>
<p>If you are really excited for some good CGI dig into the movie, otherwise not so much.</p>

<p>"Contact"(1997) by Robert Zemeckis is said to be of science fiction genre. Though, I would say, it's more of a science fiction movie where science is used to justify the religiosity of the 95%(the movie claims 95% of the world believe in God). Main point of argument is "absence of proof doesn't negate the existence". </p>
<p>A girl inspired by her father set her life in quest of extraterrestrial life. There are blocks, challenges but our protagonist overcome all of those by her sheer inertia of will. Movie is science-y in its attire but depends on cinematic turn of events to propel its story. Not much can be said without spoiling it. </p>
<p>To me, like "Forrest Gump" it is another movie where director has had a great direction while appealing to masses comfortness in vague notion of spirituality.</p>
