                <h3>It has started after all.</h3>
<p>Summer has started as much awesomely as possible for me. Write code, get feedback, update and learn. What else you need if you love to code! One of the most anticipated event for me was participating in GSOC (<a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google Summer of Code</a>) and after trying for two consecutive years I was at last <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/kbashar/5676830073815040">selected</a> this year. And I’m coding this year in Apache foundation and  to be more precise in <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/">PDFBox</a>. After almost month long community bonding phase code writing phase has after all started from 25th May.</p>
<h3>Code is being committed</h3>
<p>Though community bonding was to get introduced with the community and getting your hands wet with code base and documentation I was some steps already walked on these. So have started code earlier though didn’t make remarkable patches. Don’t know, may be it’s always slow for the first time. :D Anyway already I’ve made three patches, two of them slightly large in size :) </p>
<h3>Coding plan</h3>
<p>My mentor wants me to make little patches as those are easy to merge and refactor for both of us and I’m highly appreciating on this. The patches I’ve submitted helped me to learn a lot already while giving the community the opportunity to use the just backed features. Which in turn gives me feedback to make code better. </p>
<h3>Blogging plan</h3>
<p>I'm planning to write experience-per-patch post. I hope it also doesn't become another mountain lifting promise because of my procrastination. :D</p>

                <p>Main code for this patch was ready for GSOC as I’ve coded it <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-2748">earlier</a> for PDFReader of the PDFBox tools. So it was just about  reuseing the RecentFiles class with PDFDebugger. </p>
<p>From this patch I’ve learnt an interesting thing. In RecentFiles class I’ve used Preference API of java to store application preference data. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html">Preference API</a> gives you one instance per Package. </p>
<p>PDFReader and PDFDebugger both are in same the package so they show the same recent files log. Though I was first confused about the behaviour and was planning to move PDFDebugger to a new package but tilman happened to like it :). So a potential bug became a feature. :)</p>

                <p>As a gsoc student I'm going to code to improve the <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/1.8/commandline.html#pdfDebugger">PDFDebugger</a> tool of the <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/" title="PDFBOX">PDFBOX</a> this summer. PDFBox is from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" title="Apache">apache </a> foundation. </p>
<p>PDFDebugger helps you to inspect the internal data in a structured and readable way which in turn paves a way to debug your PDF files. The PDFBOX already has a PDFDebugger which provides some fundamental facilities to user but lacks many more which are very useful for PDF detective works. My project is to improve this tool and make it useable and friendlier for the users as much as possible. The features I'm going to add are from the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-2530">PDFBOX-2530</a> jira issue. If time permits, I may code some more. </p>
<p>My mentor is <a href="https://twitter.com/Passwort12345">Tilman Hausherr</a>. I contacted with him in mid of the November of 2014 and from the beginning he was very helpful to get me on the track. Really lucky to have someone like him right beside me as a guide in the journey of learning, exploring and doing.
I’m hopeful to spent a fun summer while completing the GSOC as success story.</p>
